   construction

0.44      2012-05-11 10:44:48 PDT-0700
 - now respecting value of configfile passed to the constructor, when used in
   conjunction with MooseX::ConfigFromFile. (Karen Etheridge)

0.41-TRIAL 2012-04-14 18:36:00 PDT-0700
 - Now bails with exit status 0, rather than dying, when printing
   requested --usage/--help information (usage printed via invalid arguments
   will still die, however). (Karen Etheridge)

0.40      2012-04-13
 - Fix tests when MooseX::ConfigFromFile is installed, with
   Getopt::Long::Descriptive >= 0.091. RT#76287
 - Pod fix from debian. Salvatore Bonaccorso <carnil@debian.org> RT#74681
 - Spelling fix from debian. Jonathan Yu <jawnsy@cpan.org> RT#74681

0.39      2012-02-03
 - Fix argument parsing in process_argv when used with ConfigFromFile so
   that -v can be used as expected, rather than being grabbed as --version

0.38      2011-12-23
 - More documentation on Getopt::Long settings and how they alter this
   role's behaviour, in particular with regards to extra_argv capturing.
   (Karen Etheridge)

0.37      2011-03-30
 - Fix missing dependency. (RT#67077)

0.36      2011-03-29
 - Fix dist.ini 'Prereq' into 'Prereqs' (Damien Krotkine)
 - MooseX::Getopt::GLD
   - change it to a MooseX::Role::Parameterized, so that it accepts
     'getopt_conf' parameter (Damien Krotkine)

0.35      2011-02-09
 - Fix missed change from Test::Exception to Test::Fatal

0.34      2011-02-08
 - The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception. (Karen
   Etheridge)
 - Move most of new_with_options logic into separate publically accessible
   process_argv method, so that arg processing can be done without actually
   creating object (Jonathan Swartz)

0.33      2010-08-26
 - Remove Test::Most from newly added test (RT#60766)

0.32      2010-08-26

 - Fix issue causing tests to fail if MooseX::SimpleConfig isn't installed.

0.30      2010-07-06
 - MooseX::Getopt::Basic
   - uses attribute insertion order when determining the order in which
     options are documented in the usage (e.g. in $obj->usage->text). (Karen
     Etheridge)

 - MooseX::Getopt::Basic
   - store the usage object to the usage attr (RT#58715)
   - properly checks whether the *option* --help, --usage, or --? were used,
     rather than the attribute 'help', 'usage' or '?' were set
 - MooseX::Getopt::GLD
   - add the usage attribute for storing the Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Usage
     object, and the help attribute for storing --help, --usage and --? state
 (RT#47865, RT#56783, RT#52474).  (Karen Etheridge)

 - MooseX::Getopt::Basic
   - Disable auto_help config in Getopt::Long, to avoid calling into pod2usage
     when the --help option is used while MooseX::ConfigFromFile is in use
     (the intent is just to fetch the value of the configfile option)
     (RT#57683). (Karen Etheridge)
